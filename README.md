Escape from Voldemort's Manor is a C++ text based game. A character is chosen to traverse through the "manor" which is created as a linked list. A space class contains pure virtual functions in which its inherited classes overrride. These spaces are arranged in a doubly linked list, each having four pointers which will dictate the four possible directions the user may move. The user will traverse through the rooms and collect the proper key to unlock the next room. Once all keys have been obtained, they move outside to fight with Voldemort.
